Online Purchase Database
Sean Novak
2020

This is a mock database made from SQL that simulates the possible function of a database for an online shopping
website. The database includes spaces for customer, supplier and bank info in addition to the actual items for 
sale on the website. It also has a separate section for billing that keeps track of purchases made by customers.
There is also a simple UI included made from python. The UI simulates a customer experience buying one or more products.
There is also a user verification system, in which you can make a new account or login from an old one. Signing in with
a manager ID and password allows you to access confidential information about customers and purchase history.
